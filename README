Scenario: 
You work for a digital agency that develops both websites and mobile apps. You have been
asked to create a mobile app that allows users to leave reviews about music artists. Users
should be able to view artists alphabetically by name or by genre. When an artist is selected the
app will take the user to a page that provides more information about the artist, this should
include an image and some information about the artist such as album or gig information. Artist
information will be available to all users but only users who are registered and logged in will be
able to leave a review. Once logged in a user will be able to add a review against an artist, this
review will be saved to the database and will be available for view to any other user. There
should be an option to register for an account. You will be designing your app for the Android
market with the intention to sell the app on Google Play (although you will not be expected to
launch the app on this store).
